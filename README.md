This is Ultra Gangster 3D, a 3D remake of my previous "Ultra Gangster: A Twin Stick Shooter Game". I decided to make this remake as part of the final project for my Game Development class at UTSA during Spring 2025. As you can probably tell from looking at the video (link provided below), this remake was never finished, nor do I have any intentions to actually finish the remake.

That said, I put a lot of time into this remake, and so it is still at least worth talking about, but I will never give this a proper release. In its current form, it is essentially the original 2D game, but in 3D, and instead of being a twin stick shooter, it is now a first person shooter. All the credits to the original still apply here as well. All the levels are essentially the same, with a few minor differences.

Included in this repo is a .zip file containing a build of the game for windows, if you really wish to try it out.
